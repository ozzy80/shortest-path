# Shortest path algorithm

Algorithm for finding all shortest paths between two points on given xml map 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

If you want to run shortest-path Java project on your local machine you need to have installed:

```
* JDK 1.8+
* Maven 3.5.1+
```

### Installing

Run configurations for Eclipse IDE have been included. For manual setup it is most easily to build project via Maven. Just import the Maven project into your IDE of choice.


## Running the tests

Shortest path application is full covered with JUNIT tests. The easiest way to run tests is using Eclipse IDE.
